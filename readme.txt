Tired of using <hr> tags in the Text Editor? Now you can simply add shortcode [hr] to your content in the Visual Editor to insert a horizontal line.

== Description ==

Instead of shifting to the text editor, inserting the < hr > tag, shifting back to the visual editor, with a chance that you delete the < hr > tag by mistake. You can now simply add shortcode [hr] anywhere, and multiple times, in your content in the Visual Editor to insert a horizontal line.

This will make your content mark-up mucher easier to read and manage in the backend.

Additionally you can also add top and buttom margin to the horizontal line. Please see the FAQ for more information how to do it using shortcode parameters.
